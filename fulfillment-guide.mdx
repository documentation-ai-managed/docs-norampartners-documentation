## Returns Grading and Repair

Manage returns with our structured grading process. Items receive condition scores for resale or repair.

| Grade | Condition Description | Action Taken |
|-------|-----------------------|--------------|
| A     | Like new, unopened    | Restock immediately |
| B     | Opened, functional    | Sanitize and repack |
| C     | Minor damage          | Repair in-house |
| D     | Non-functional        | Liquidate or recycle |

<Expandable title="Repair Procedures" default-open="false">

Follow these steps for C-grade items:

1. Diagnose issue (e.g., cable fault on `SKU-ELEC-456`).
2. Repair using certified parts.
3. Test functionality.
4. Regrade to B or A.
